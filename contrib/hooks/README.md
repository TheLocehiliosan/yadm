## Contributed Hooks

Although these [hooks][hooks-help] are available as part of the official
**yadm** source tree, they have a somewhat different status. The intention is to
keep interesting and potentially useful hooks here, building a library of
examples that might help others.

In some cases, an experimental new feature can be build entirely with hooks, and
this is a place to share it.

I recommend *careful review* of any code from here before using it. No
guarantees of code quality is assumed.
